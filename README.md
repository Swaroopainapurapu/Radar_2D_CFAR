# Radar_2D_CFAR
 2D CFAR IMPLEMENTATION
This project is a solution for the Radar Module in the Sensor Fusion Nanodegree

Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process
Loop over elements of RDM array each iteration selecting one cell to be the CUT (Cell Under Test)
for i = Tr+Gr+1 : (Nr/2)-(Gr+Tr)
for j = Td+Gd+1 : Nd-(Gd+Td)
For each iteration loop over the training cells "excluding the guarding cells" to sum their values
for p = i-(Tr+Gr) : i+(Tr+Gr)
for q = j-(Td+Gd) : j+(Td+Gd)
Calculate the average of the noise value
noise_level = noise_level + db2pow(RDM(p,q));
Convert using pow2db
th = pow2db(noise_level/(2*(Td+Gd+1)*2*(Tr+Gr+1)-(Gr*Gd)-1));
Add the offset value
If the CUT is greater then the threshold replace it by 1, else 0
and thatâ€™s all for the Implementation.
Selection of Training, Guard cells and offset
Tr = 10, Td = 8 For both Range and Doppler Training Cells.
Gr = 4, Gd = 4 For both Range and Doppler Guard Cells.
offset = 1.4 the offset value.
Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges
This was done throught sclicing the output such that we have the surrounding rows and columns depending on the Training cells for both range and doppler.
RDM(union(1:(Tr+Gr),end-(Tr+Gr-1):end),:) = 0; % Rows
RDM(:,union(1:(Td+Gd),end-(Td+Gd-1):end)) = 0; % Columns

Output:
This is the output for a target at 110m moving at -20 m/s relative speed
